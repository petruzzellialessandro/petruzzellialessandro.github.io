I am Alessandro Petruzzelli, a PhD student in computer science. I have a master's degree in data science, and my research field is recommender systems, particularly conversational recommender systems. I am interested in using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to improve the performance of recommender systems. My future goals are to pursue a PhD in computer science and to continue my research in recommender systems. In this personal website, you can find posts about my other passions, such as music.
