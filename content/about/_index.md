## Currently

Winner of the scholarship "ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION OF RECOMMENDATION METHODS AND ALGORITHMS FOR THE PERSONALIZATION OF SUGGESTIONS IN THE RETAIL SECTOR" funded by the SWAP research group of the University of Bari.

Through a careful analysis of purchase data, consumer preferences, and behavioral patterns, the challenges and opportunities for improving the personalization of recommendations were identified.
During the research process, deep learning and data analysis methodologies were applied to refine existing recommendation algorithms and develop new solutions. Thanks to these methodologies, more accurate and relevant recommendation models were created, able to provide personalized suggestions to consumers based on their specific interests and preferences.

## Projects

__Design and Development of a Content-based Recommender System to Support a Conversational Agent__<br>
>>With the aim of providing an alternative to a graph-based recommendation system, the project focused on the implementation and comparison of several models for content representation. Thanks to the implementation of these models, it was possible to implement a content-based recommendation system that, in addition to being more effective, allows the implementation of a process of explaining the recommendation. In particular, for the project, vector representation models of textual content were evaluated, thus providing a preprocessing through Natural Language Processing techniques.

__Transformer-Based Conversational Recommendation based on Knowledge Graph__<br>
>>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have attracted a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to provide personalized recommendations through multi-turn interactions. This study is based on an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions, focusing on two main areas: recommendation systems that use deep learning techniques and end-to-end conversational systems. The project described in this study falls into the second category. The proposed idea is to use a Transformer architecture to develop a CRS. By exploiting self-attention, this solution is able to learn a representation for each element to be recommended. However, the experiments conducted for this study have shown that the integration of external knowledge from a Knowledge Graph can improve the accuracy of the model if it is integrated into the early encoding layers of the architecture.
